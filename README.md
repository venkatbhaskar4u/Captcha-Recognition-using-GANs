# Captcha Recognition using GANs

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for automatic CAPTCHA recognition. CAPTCHAs are widely used as a security measure to distinguish human users from automated bots. Solving CAPTCHAs with machine learning is both a benchmark for advancing computer vision and a critical study in cybersecurity. This repo explores how GAN-based architectures can improve the robustness and accuracy of text-based CAPTCHA recognition systems.

## Key Features
- **Synthetic CAPTCHA Generation:** Uses GANs to create and augment diverse CAPTCHA images for robust training datasets and improved model performance.
- **Deep Learning Pipeline:** Trains a model to automate the recognition and decoding of distorted, multi-character CAPTCHAs.
- **Model Architecture:** Explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and GANs for both image creation and adversarial robustness.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Tracks accuracy, precision, recall, and character-level decoding performance.
- **Visualization:** Includes side-by-side visual comparisons of real, generated, and decoded CAPTCHA examples.
- **Adaptable Framework:** Flexible codebase for expanding to new CAPTCHA styles or including more robust security bypass strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, update as appropriate)
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Publicly available or synthetically generated CAPTCHA images, covering common formats (distorted text, overlapping characters, background noise).
- GANs used to expand the variation and difficulty of the CAPTCHA dataset for training and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/Captcha-Recognition-using-GANs.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download or generate a batch of CAPTCHA images (see notebook for instructions).
4. Open `Captcha_Recognition_GANs.ipynb` in Jupyter and follow the step-by-step workflow.
5. Evaluate results and visualize model performance.

## Results & Example Outputs
- Achieves **60% character-level or image-level accuracy** against challenging CAPTCHA datasets.
- Side-by-side display of original, GAN-generated, and model-decoded CAPTCHA images.
- Benchmark comparisons: GAN-augmented models vs. traditional data augmentation pipelines.
- Low accuracy in CAPTCHA recognition with GANs is expected due to severe technical challenges: CAPTCHAs are intentionally distorted and noisy, making character segmentation and sequence recognition extremely difficult. Additionally, GAN-generated data often fails to capture the full diversity and adversarial variations of real CAPTCHAs, and typical deep learning models struggle to generalize across these unpredictable styles and overlapping characters. As a result, even advanced models are limited by complexity, inadequate data, and the design of CAPTCHAs to resist automated decoding.

## Applications & Impact
- **Security Research:** Evaluates the vulnerability of existing CAPTCHA systems to advanced ML attacks.
- **Computer Vision:** Pushes the limits of deep learning for image translation, denoising, and sequence decoding.
- **Dataset Augmentation:** Innovative use of GANs to synthetically extend constrained training data for rare or new CAPTCHA styles.
